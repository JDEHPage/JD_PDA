require_relative('card.rb')
class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

# The if question is incorrect as it's trying to assign the value of 1 to the card object that the .value function has been called on


  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card.name
  else
    card2
  end
end
end

# The method must begin with def not dif.
# There needs to be a comma , between the fed in variables.
# The first return needs to be made to card1 so it's a existing variable within the method and there is no .name method so its reccomented that the return be changed to a string with the card variables of .suit and .value interpolated into it.
# The second return need to have a return added as well as the same string interpolation as the first but with card2 as the object.
# There are too many end statements, only 2 are required.


def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end

# You will need to supply an array called cards
# The variable of total need to be defined as something in this case = 0.
# The return string needs to be moved outside of the if loop to allow it to run though all variables in the array cards.
# The variable 0 needs to be interpolated into he string that is returned from the function and the string should be updated with the word value to read "You have a total value of".

<!-- Overall the class is missing a end and requires one to work -->
